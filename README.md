# Storefront UI

**This project is on the early stages of development. Not ready to use.**

Highly customizable and elegant UI framework for eCommerce (and not only) based on Vue.js and [Google Retail UX Playbook](https://services.google.com/fh/files/events/pdf_retail_ux_playbook.pdf). Made with ❤️ by [Vue Storefront](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront) team & [Divante](https;//divante.co).

# What makes it unique?

Full customization and great developer experience are our primar focuses. You can easly change almost every aspect of provided components and use them to make stunning eCommerce shops (and not only)!

**Here are the key characteristics of Storefront UI:**

- Ability to customize any aspect of the library.
- Seamless upgrades
- High-level global customization can be done through SCSS variables
- Component content customization with slots.
- Component design customization with pure css BEM classes instead of countless props.
- Possibility to compose your own components from partials (markup/Vue instance/SCSS)
- Implementation of [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) (with limit to atoms, molecules and organisms)

# How to try it?

Storefront UI is not ready to use in projects yet. We plan to release working version before the end of April 2019.
If you want to play with components anyway there are two options:


```js
import StorefrontUI from "@storefrontui/vue";

Vue.use(StorefrontUI);
```
