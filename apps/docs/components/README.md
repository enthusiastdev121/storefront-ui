# Storefront UI

Welcome to the Storefront UI Docs 

This project extends our [Base Layer](https://docs.alokai.com/community/contributing/docs/base-layer) to give you all the modules, components, and features available in the deployed Alokai docs.

### Place images directly in the `content` folder

If you need to use images in your content, you can place them directly in the `content` folder. Then, you can reference them in your content using the relative path.
