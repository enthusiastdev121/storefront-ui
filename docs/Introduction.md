# About

Storefront UI is customization-first and elegant
UI framework for eCommerce (and not only)
based on Vue.js and
[Google Retail UX Playbook](https://services.google.com/fh/files/events/pdf_retail_ux_playbook.pdf).

## Current state of the project

**StorefrontUI is currently in ALPHA which means
it is not suitable for production!
Expect things to be broken and APIs to possibly change.**

## Installation

With Yarn:

```
npm install --save @storefrontui/vue
```

With NPM:

```
npm install --save @storefrontui/vue
```

Create `sfui.scss` file at the root of your project if it wasn't generated automatically.
