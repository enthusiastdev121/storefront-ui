**StorefrontUI is currently in ALPHA which means
it is not suitable for production!
Expect things to be broken and APIs to possibly change.**

Customization-first and elegant UI framework for eCommerce (and not only) based on Vue.js and [Google Retail UX Playbook](https://services.google.com/fh/files/events/pdf_retail_ux_playbook.pdf). Made with ❤️ by [Vue Storefront](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront) team & [Divante](https;//divante.co).

## Join us!

StorefrontUI is a completely new approach for component libraries oriented
around customization possibilities instead of out of the box possibilities.
It's a great goal but it will take a lot of time to achieve it only by ourselves.
The project is open source and free to use.

If you'd like to support us and join the team please write to me:
