# Working with alpaca

We agreed with Snowdog to create common format for both Alpaca and StorefrontUI to make it easier to use both.

This is why it's perfectly fine to use alpaca components as a base for SFUI components. The idea si to pick the one that suits us and customize it according to [the same rules](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/storefront-ui/blob/master/docs/customization.md) we have in SFUI.
The customized alpaca component is a new SfUI one.
