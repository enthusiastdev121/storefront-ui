# USAGE

## Remove comments

> Removal comments functionality is available only within test files, so the ones with`.cy.ts` `.PageObject.ts` filename suffix.

We can use `// ${framework}` and `// end ${framework}` where `${framework}` is a name of the framework (e.g. react) to mark specific part of the test code as framework-specific. Framework-specific test code **will be removed from the test suite code when test runs against other frameworks**.

Example:
```ts
describe('test scenario', () => {
  it('common test case', () => { ... });
  // vue
  it('vue-specific test case', () => { ... });
  // end vue
});
```

## Import Component

**Important**: for specifying framework-specific component imports use `// import ${framework}` and `// end import ${framework}` instead, for example:
```ts
// import vue
import VueComponent from 'packages/sfui/frameworks/vue/components/VueComponent/VueComponent.vue';
// end import vue
// import react
import ReactComponent from 'packages/sfui/frameworks/react/components/VueComponent/VueComponent';
// end import react
```

## Why?

When using our internal `mount()` util we need to provide it with a separate configuration for React and Vue components. Unfortunately, at the same time, we don't want to import React components when running tests against Vue framework and other way around - we don't want to import Vue component when testing React.
To handle this case, we need to mark imports, so our internal tooling can replace them properly with fake modules. So, for example: when running a Vue tests - real React components won't be imported.

Having said that there is better solution for marking your component imports than using comments above. For most of cases, using our `useComponent` util will be a better fit. It allows you to import the react/vue components and uses the same comment under the hood. Example:

```ts
const {vue: VsfRadioGroupVue, react: VsfRadioGroupReact} = await useComponent('VsfRadioGroup');
```

This util will work perfectly for cases where the component does exist both in React and Vue frameworks. In a situation when the component is not exported from one of framework bundles (for example when you're testing a React-only component) you should use import comments as a fallback strategy:  `// import react` and `// end import react`.

## Import alteration

Other imports will be changed to match the framework automatically. E.g.: `../../some/vue/types.ts` will be changed into `../../some/react/types.ts` when the test runs against react.

## Mount

Mount method provides possibility to mount multiple frameworks at once (see `packages/tests/utils/mount.tsx`) with a unified API.

## Mounting Vue components

When mounting Vue component you can use any configuration options that are supported by [vue-test-utils packages](https://test-utils.vuejs.org/api/#mount). Like:
```ts
mount({
    vue: {
        component: SomeVueComponent,
        props: {...},
        slots: {...},
    }
});
```
If you need to change props values during your test case you can do it by passing reactive Vue `ref` as a prop:
```ts
it('some test', () => {
  const someProp = ref();
  mount({vue: { props: someProp }});

  expect(elementUIDependingOnThisProp).not.to.be.changed;
  someProp.value = 'changed ref';
  expect(elementUIDependingOnThisProp).to.be.changed;
});
```

## Mounting React components

For `react` we provide `<Wrapper />` component that allows us utilize `ref`s (from `Vue` package) as reactive props for tested React component. `ref` values might be changed during the test run exactly the same way as within pure `Vue` tests. Example:

```tsx
it('some test', () => {
  const someProp = ref();
  mount({react:
      <Wrapper
          open={someProp}
          onOpenChange={(e: boolean) => someProp.value = e}
          component={VsfNavigationTopReact}
      />
  });

  expect(elementUIDependingOnThisProp).not.to.be.changed;
  someProp.value = 'changed ref';
  expect(elementUIDependingOnThisProp).to.be.changed;
});
```

`<Wrapper />` API props:

* component - component that will be tested
* all props and children will be passed directly to the original component (with Vue `ref`s being reactively unwrapped).
