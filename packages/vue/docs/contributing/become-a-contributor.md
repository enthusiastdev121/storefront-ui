# Become a contributor

_Welcome and thank you so much for thinking of contributing to **StorefrontUI**_ ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç.

We want you to have fun contributing with us, so let's go over a few important guidelines before getting started.

## Important resources

* [Our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/GS8hqFS). This is the place where we discussed about new features, exchanging questions between the core team, contributors (`#contributors`) and StorefrontUI users.
* [Our component storybook](http://storefrontui-storybook.netlify.com/) - Playground for our components
* [Our current issues](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/storefront-ui/issues) - Where we keep track of all the bugs, feature requests reported by our community members.
* [Our current Roadmap](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/storefront-ui/projects/1) - The status of our library in long term.

* [Our Figma component design](https://www.figma.com/file/hrwE3VsMBHgdJoS86rVr4W/Desktop-%26-Mobile-Vue-Storefront?node-id=99%3A0) - Where contains the designs of all the existing/future components in the library.

## Repository's structure

StorefrontUI is an open-source UI library which is written **initially for Vue.js developers**. Like any other Vue.js project, you should be familiar with the basic of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) before starting to contribute. This is to help you **understand** the code **faster** and thus make it **easier** for you in contributing.

Our repo structure follows [monorepo development strategy](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/monorepos). It consists of two main projects: **shared** and **vue**, both located under `packages` folder.

```
storefrontUI
|__/packages
  |__/shared
  |__/vue
```
* **shared** - Contains all CSS stylings of components and icons used within StorefrontUI. This is to ensure design consistency between our future projects.

* **vue** - This is the main project that contains main Storefront UI Vue components code in `src`, storybook config in `config`, customized scripts in `scripts` and main documentation written in [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) will be found in `docs`.

```
./vue
|__/config
|__/docs
|__/scripts
|__/src
```

We selected this strategy to enable the reusability of resources between future extension to other frameworks such as React.js.
