## Repository's structure

StorefrontUI is an open-source UI library which is written **initially for Vue.js developers**. Like any other Vue.js project, you should be familiar with the basic of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) before starting to contribute. This is to help you **understand** the code **faster** and thus make it **easier** for you in contributing.

Our repo structure follows [monorepo development strategy](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/monorepos). It consists of two main projects: **shared** and **vue**, both located under `packages` folder.

```
storefrontUI
|__/packages
  |__/shared
  |__/vue
```
* **shared** - Contains all CSS stylings of components and icons used within StorefrontUI. This is to ensure design consistency between our future projects.

* **vue** - This is the main project that contains Storefront UI Vue components code and main documentation. 

We selected this strategy to enable the reusability of resources between future extension to other frameworks such as React.js.
