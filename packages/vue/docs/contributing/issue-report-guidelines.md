# How to report an issue

In order for us to ensure proper planning for any bugfix or feature development workflow, we are appreciate if our beloved reporters follow the below guidelines üòÉ

## Use issue tracker for the right purpose

As part of maintaining our OSS workflow, StorefrontUI uses Github issue tracker **ONLY** for [bugs](bug-report) and [feature requests (RFC)](#feature-requests-rfc).

:::warning
* It is **NOT** for requesting a personal support or asking a question. Use [our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/GS8hqFS) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) or even [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home).
* It is **NOT** for social media, respect others' opinions and proper languages are **required**.
:::

## Issue types

For organizing and tracking purpose, issues on StorefrontUI are divided into the main following types:

* Bug report
* Feature request (RFC)

## Before reporting

Plese do the following checks:
* **Double check** [the current issues](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/storefront-ui/issues) with the help of Github issue search. This is to avoid report duplication.
* If it is an issue about **component behavior**, check our [Components Playground](http://storybook.storefrontui.io) or [Components Documentaton](/components/Accordion.md) to make sure it is indeed a bug üêõ, and not an intended feature.
* If it's about **technical questions** or just to **verify it is technical related**, refer to our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/GS8hqFS) first. Our contributors and core team will be more than happy to help.
* In addition, if it is about **feature request**, refer to our current [Roadmap]() to see if your request exists and is planned.

Once your issue is verified from the above checks, it's time to create your issue using [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/storefront-ui/issues/new) with the right template recommendations below.

## Issue template
**Issue title** is first impression of the developer to identify the issue quickly. A good title should contain brief, clear and concise explanation about the issue with the important keypoints.

:::tip GOOD TITLE
[BUG]Precommit checks for shared package fail
:::
:::danger BAD TITLE
Can't commit.
:::

### Feature requests (RFC)

OSS project can't live without improvements üòâ. So feature requests are always welcome.

:::warning
Please take a moment to validate if your request is within the scope of StorefrontUI by contacting us on [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/GS8hqFS), or DM to [@StorefronUI](https://twitter.com/StorefrontUI)
:::

Our feature request, unlike bug report, is very simple. There are two main fields needed for developers' understanding:
#### User story
This is the use case of the requested feature. In order to convince developers of the need for this feature try to clarify as many aspects and context related to the feature as possible, such as:
* What is the user flow of the feature?
* What is expected?
* What generic problem does this feature solve?
* Any other benefit this feature provides users?

The more details are provided, the stronger and clearer your request will appear to developers.
#### Description / Proposed idea
Sometimes developers get developer-block also. It's similar to writer-block in a way. And not all developers are good in proposing feature API. In such circumstance, it's very helpful to give them a hint or your suggestion on how you think the feature should be developed. Sharing is caring, right? 

### Bug report

[Bug report template](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/storefront-ui/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) is standard placeholder for every new bug found. 

:::tip TITLE WITH PREFIX
Bug report will be populated with a title prefix `[BUG]` upon creation:

`[BUG]<bug issue title>`
:::

As always, some important pre-guidelines:
1. **If the issue has been fixed before**, try to reproduce it with the latest `master` branch.
2. To help us understand the exact issue, try to **isolate the problem** by a [reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/), steps to repoduce and a live example if possible.

:::tip A GOOD BUG REPORT
A good bug report should be **clear**, as **detailed** as possible **without** the need of chasing for more information.
:::

#### General description
What is the bug you are reporting? Summary the bug in a bit of more details (but still concise) than the bug title.

#### Steps to reproduce
This is most significant part, allowing developer to reproduce the issue and backtrack why it happens. If a bug can be reproduced, it's 90% fixable.

Hence developers need you to describe each and every step precisely and with as much imformation as possible, even the most and seem-less-important detail.

```
Example:
1. Navigate to Contributing.md
2. Click on Become A Contributor link.

```

If possible, include a live record of the reproducing process. This avoids any misunderstanding and unnecessary ping pong conversations between reporter and developer.

#### Expected & actual behavior

It's a must to state the result you expect and the actual observed one so everyone is in sync on the bug and clarify in case there is any mis-match.

```
Examples:
Expected behavior: Open link to become a contributor documentation page.

Actual behavior: Received 404 page.
```

#### Code examples
If there is any code or extra configuration involved (like how you use the component in practice), don't forget to include them. Either CodeSandbox or just simply Markdown code is acceptable. This is to help us get the bug reproduced faster.

#### Additional information
In addition to the above fields, more information may be required to speed up bug fix, including:
* **Screenshots** - It can be console logs, terminal logs, actual problematic behavior, etc.
* **Environment** - It can be which browser, OS, and devices that relates to the issue.
* **Repository branch, version used, tech stacks used, etc**
