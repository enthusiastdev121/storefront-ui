Storefront UI is installed as a dependency to your project:

```bash
npm install --save @storefront-ui/vue
# or
yarn add @storefront-ui/vue
```

Once the library is installed, you need to import its **root stylesheet**. It contains _global_ styles and SCSS variables. **Component styles** are automatically imported as part of `.vue` files for each component.

We recommend putting it in your `main.js` or the root component of your application.

```js
import "@storefront-ui/vue/styles.scss";
```

That's all! Now you can import any of Storefront UI components like this:

```js
import { SfComponentName } from "@storefront-ui/vue";
```

<div class="alert warning">

For best extendability and performance we ship Storefront UI as (unpackaged) source code which requires **webpack** in your project to use the library.

Storefront UI is working out of the box with **Nuxt** and **Vue CLI 2 & 3**!
In order to use it in custom projects you need the following webpack loaders: `css-loader@>1.0.1`, `scss-loader`, `sass-loader`, `vue-loader`

## Using with Nuxt

To use Storefront UI in a Nuxt project you need to include it's transpilation during build process using nuxt.config.js or your alternative webpack config.
For example in Nuxt 2-edge all you have to do is to add `/^@storefront-ui/` to the [transpile.build](https://nuxtjs.org/api/configuration-build/#transpile) array e.g.

```
module.exports = {
	build: {
		transpile: [/^@storefront-ui/],
	},
}
```

Make sure that you already have all required webpack loaders.

## Customization

Storefront UI is very flexible in terms of customization. You can read [here](/setup-customization.md) about its capabilities.
